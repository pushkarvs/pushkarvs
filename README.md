# Hi there, I'm Pushkar Dangi! 👋

🚀 **Code Wrangler | MERN Enthusiast | AI Explorer**

I'm a developer who talks to computers (and they usually listen). I specialize in building cool things with React, Node.js, and backend magic. Whether it's creating AI-powered apps or debugging code at 2 AM with coffee in hand, I thrive on solving tech puzzles. Currently, I'm diving deeper into AI/ML to make computers even smarter (so they can debug my code for me).

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication & Security:** JWT, Encryption
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Tools & Platforms:** VS Code, Postman, Cloudinary, OpenAI API
